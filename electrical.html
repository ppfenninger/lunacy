									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>The firmware for this project is split between three PIC microcontrollers and an Arduino. One microcontroller controls the start and stop conditions, the other two microcontrollers control the obstacles which are loosely split up between the right and left side, and the Arduino controls the joysticks, the two tilt mazes, and the countdown timer.</p>

									<h2>The Controls</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<p>The start-stop microcontroller controls which sides of the game are on. When the game first boots up, both sides of the game is off. The player then has to insert a coin and press the start button to begin the game which turns on both sides of the game. The sides of the game remain on until either a side wins, or time runs out and the remaining balls have either reached the goal or fallen off the obstacles. The sides remain on when time has run out until the balls are back in the ball return. This gives the players one last chance to win and also ensures that the balls don't get stuck in any of the obstacles. Once both balls are inside of the game, the game shuts off and the right side pin goes high if the players won, and the left side pin goes high if the players lost.</p>

											<p>The left microcontroller controls the popper, the force gauge for the popper, the swishel swashel, and shoot the moon. Aside from half of swishel swashel, these obstacles are the ones that the left player has control of. </p>
											<p>The game remains off until both the right and left signal pins go high. At which point both sides turn on. Each side remains on and continues to accept user input until the signal pin for that side goes low. The game fully turns off when both the left and right side signal pins go low. </p>

									<h2>Power</h2>

										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<p>Powering this entire system created a large challenge. All of the servos and micrcontrollers had to run off of 5V, the coin acceptor had to run off of 12V, and the solenoids had to run off of anywhere from 12V to 36V. We could not find a single power supply that could supply enough current at those 5V, 12V, and 36V, so we decided to split up our power circuitry into two power supplies: one that can supply 5V and 12V, and one that can supply 36V. The servos, microcontrollers, Neopixels, and Arudino are all powered from the 5V supply, the coin acceptor is powered from the 12V supply, and the solenoids are all powered from teh 36V supply. In total with all of our deives, we needed about 5.8 Amps at 5V, 0.5 Amps at 12V, and about 3.2 Amps at 36V.  </p>
