										<h1>Mecanical</h1>
									</header>
											<p>The mecanical component of Luncay was very complicated. There are many parts that had to be built and iterated upon so that they all fit together nicely. The CAD files of all of our components can be found <a href="#">here.</a></p>

									<h2>The Box</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<p> The box was manufactured using the Shopbot at Olin College of Engineering and is made out of 1/2" MDF. The sides of the box all connect with captured nuts which enables us to easily remove the sides if needed. The top of the box is covered in polycarbonate which prevents any balls from going flying outside of the box.</p>

									<h2>The Playing Field</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<p> The playing field was laser cut and is made out of 1/4" plywood. It is supported by pillars on either end and has cutouts for the various obstacles. The playing field is sloped at a 3 degree angle so that if a ball falls off of an obstacle, it rolls towards the sides of the box and falls onto the ball return ramp. </p>

									<h2>The ball Return</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<p>The ball return is designed to catch the ball after it falls off of the playing field and return it to the ball return holes at the front of the box. It consists of a ramp with on either side of the box that slopes towards the front of the box. Towards the end of each side of the ball return, there is a door attached to the servo and a break beam sensor. The door allows us to keep the ball inside the game when the game is not running, and the break beam sensor lets us know when a ball has fallen into the ramp. </p>

									<h2>Right Side Obstacles</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<h3>Uncovered Tilt Maze</h3>
											<div class="12u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/finalUncoveredTilt.jpg" alt="finalUncoveredTilt" /></span></div>
											<p>In this obstacle, the player uses a joystick to control the tilt of the maze. The player has to navigate from one side to the other without getting stuck or falling into the black hole. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<h3>Popper</h3>
											<div class="12u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/finalPopper.jpg" alt="finalPopper" /></span></div>
											<p>The player has to pop the ball from one level to the other to pass through this obstacle. This obstacle has a corresponding force guage that determines how hard the pop will be when the player presses the button. If the player presses the button at the wrong time, the ball either won't pop high enough to get to the next obstacle, or will fly off the obstacle.</p>
												

										</div>

									<div class="row">
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<h3>Swishel Swashel</h3>
											<div class="12u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/finalSwish.jpg" alt="finalSwish" /></span></div>
											<p>This is a cooperative obstacles. The three ramps on swishel swashel rotate back and forth. The goal is to get the ball from one side of the ramps to the other. Initially, the ball rolls onto the first ramp and get stuck in the hole in the middle of it. When the second ramp lines up with the first ramp, one player has to press a button to momentarily stop the rotation, and another player has to press another button at the same time to actuate a solenoid which pops the ball out of the hole so that it rolls down the ramp and onto the next one. This process continues until the ball is off of the obstacle.  </p>
										</div>
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<h3>Shoot the Moon </h3>
											<div class="12u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/finalMoon.png" alt="finalMoon" /></span></div>
											<p>This obstacle is also commonly referred to as Catch the Moon. Basically, there is a servo that controls how far away the two rods are, and the player has to use a slide potentiometer to move the rods to get the ball from one side to the other. There is a slight incline from the start to the end, so that the player has to move the rods to get from one side to the other.</p>

									<h2>Left Side Obstacles</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<h3>Weeble Wobble</h3>
											<div class="12u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/finalWeeble.jpg" alt="finalWeeble" /></span></div>
											<p>In this obstacle, the player presses a button which actuates a solenoid and switched the orientation of the ramps. The player has to time button presses so that the ball rolls along the ramps without flying off or moving backwards. This is the first obstacle in the traditional screwball scramble game. </p>
												

										</div>
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<h3>Ball Pass</h3>
											<div class="12u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/finalBallPass.jpg" alt="finalBallPass" /></span></div>	
											<p>Ball Pass is the second cooperative obstacle. Each half rotates and is controlled by a potentiometer, and each player has control of the rotation of one half. The players have to pass the ball from the magnetic arm to the space ship arm and then on to the next obstacle.</p>
											
										</div>

										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<h3>Covered Tilt Maze</h3>
											<div class="12u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/finalCoveredTilt.png" alt="finalCoveredTilt" /></span></div>	
											<p>Covered tilt maze has the exact same mechanism as uncovered tilt maze, except this time the player can't see inside! The pattern of the tilt maze is printed on the top and the player has to trust their insticts to know where the ball is located. There are no black holes in this tilt maze, but it is possible to hit is dead end if you go the wrong direction. </p>
											
										</div>
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<h3>Lever Toss</h3>
											<div class="12u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/finalLever.jpg" alt="finalLever" /></span></div>
											Lever toss, like popper involved a force guage, a button, and a solenoid. The player has to time their button press to the constantly moving force guage. The ball will only land in the goal if enough force is applied. Otherwise, it will either go flying off or it won't go anywhere.
