									<h2>Chloe Grubb</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="8u 12u$(small)">
											<p>Chloe is a member of the class of 2019 at Olin College of Engineering. She is majoring in Engineering with Robotics. She chose robotics because she enjoys many different types of engineering, including mechanical, electrical, and programming. Her main goals were to focus on the mechanical and electrical aspects of this project, and also to practice her design skills to create an aesthetically pleasing and engaging project. She also wanted this to be project that people could interact with and would continue to work past the Elecanisms semester. That meant trying to create something that was fairly robust, and modular in case of repair.</p>

										<div class="8u 12u$(small)">
											<p>Andrew is a passionate mechanical engineering student who knows how to get to the root of a problem. His passion for STEM began in his days as a budding engineer's club student in middle school. His teachers planted the seeds of inspiration and he wooden be at Olin without them. His favorite plant is the venus fly trap. His learning goals included learning more about mechanical design with a focus on integrated systems, designing a product with a high degree of finish, and developing teaming strategies around specific sub-teams.</p>

											<p>Paige is a member of the class of 2019 at Olin College of Engineering. She is majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Paige enjoys making complicated wiring systems at the last minute and not being able to test code until a few hours before the project is due. Her goal for this project was to not set anything on fire. So far, she has been able to accomplish those goals. </p>

									<h2>Screwball Paul</h2>

										<div class="8u 12u$(small)">
											<p>We won Screwball Paul during our team bonding event at Fun and Games in Natick Massachusetts. He is our team mascot and has helped us through all of our struggles during this project. Paul is not majoring in anything. He makes his living as a Screwball Scramble referee. His creepy smile and unrelentary stare has been said to make players extremely uncomfortable, but cheating has been nonexistent since he took over enforcing the rules.</p>
